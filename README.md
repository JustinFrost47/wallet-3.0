# Crypto Wallet 3.0

This is a simple crypto wallet that I built during my web3 learning journey at 100xDevs cohort. The workflow is straightforward: users can create a new mnemonic phrase and generate their key pairs, or they can bring their own mnemonic keys. I deliberately avoided saving the phrase in browser's local storage due to security concerns. Feel free to browse around , happy coding
